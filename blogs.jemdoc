I am making notes of talks/chapters I read for myself. These are highly informal and are not a substitute of the original resource. However, I put them here to consolidate all the things in one place. It's a bonus if someone ends up benefitting from these.

- I am reading first three chapters of Bishop Machine Learning book and maintaining notes.\n
 Notes for Bishop Chapter 1 [https://hackmd.io/@apoorv-vs/bishop-chapter-1 here].
