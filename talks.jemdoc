~~~
I am a first year PhD student at the department of Computer Science at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering, where I am supported by the School of Engineering Fellowship. I am advised by Dr Chris Musco. I am a part of the Algorithms and Foundations Group.
Before joining NYU, I was a visiting researcher for four months at INRIA Lille where I worked with Dr Hemant Tyagi and Dr Mihai Cucuringu (Univ of Oxford). Before that I was a Project Associate for a year in the Dept of Computer Science and Automation, Indian Institute of Science, where I worked with Dr Anand Louis and Dr Amit Deshpande (Microsoft Research, India). I obtained my undergraduate degree from IIIT Bangalore.
