\n \n
I am a first year PhD student at the department of Computer Science at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering, where I am supported by the School of Engineering Fellowship. I am advised by [https://www.chrismusco.com/ Dr Chris Musco]. I am a part of the [https://wp.nyu.edu/tandonschoolofengineering-algorithms/ Algorithms and Foundations Group]. \n
Before joining NYU, I was a visiting researcher for four months at [https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-lille-nord-europe INRIA Lille] where I worked with [https://hemant-tyagi.github.io/ Dr Hemant Tyagi] and [http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cucuring/ Dr Mihai Cucuringu] (Univ of Oxford). Before that I was a Project Associate for a year in the [https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/ Dept of Computer Science and Automation], [https://iisc.ac.in/ Indian Institute of Science], where I worked with [https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~anandl/ Dr Anand Louis] and [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/amitdesh/ Dr Amit Deshpande] (Microsoft Research, India). I obtained my undergraduate degree from [https://www.iiitb.ac.in/ IIIT Bangalore].
